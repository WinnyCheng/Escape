Beta Todo List
======================================


============================================
Movement class
 - store movement pattern and attributes
 - check if a move follows pattern and attributes (abideRules function)
      - use BFS Algorithm to find path
      - represent current state of board as graph/map to run BFS
      
      Tests
      - OrthoMovementRules - Done
          - linear pattern (no jump, no fly, no unblocked)
          - orthogonal=omni pattern (no jump, no fly, no unblocked)
          - with jump
          - with fly
          - with unblocked
      - SquareMovementRules - Done
          - linear pattern (no jump, no fly, no unblocked)
          - orthogonal pattern (no jump, no fly, no unblocked)
          - diagonal pattern (no jump, no fly, no unblocked)
          - omni pattern (no jump, no fly, no unblocked)
          - with jump
          - with fly
          - with unblocked
      - HexMovementRules - Done
      	  - linear pattern (no jump, no fly, no unblocked)
          - omni pattern (no jump, no fly, no unblocked)
          - with jump
          - with fly
          - with unblocked
==========================================
 
EscapePiece
 - canMove -> calls abideRules function in Movement class and return what it returns
=============================================================================
 
EscapeGameManager
 - move -> calls canMove from EscapePiece and removes/place pieces on board
 
 Tests (For each coordinate type: Square, OrthoSquare, Hex)
    - from coordinate doesn't have a piece = false (check for null)
    - move piece to another postion where there is already a piece of same player = false 
    	(check pieces are still in original positions/testing getPieceAt)
    - move piece to position with opponent piece and capture = true (check piece is replaced)
    - move piece to exit = true (check piece not at exit position)
    - check make coordinate makes the right coordinate
=================================================================================

Configurations Exception
 - Distance for Fly Must
 - Cannot have both Distance and Fly
 - Need at least one pieceType
 - Need movementpattern
 - Need pieceName
