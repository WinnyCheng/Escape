Gamma
======================================
Notes:
 - VALUE attribute is default 1
     - each piece needs a value attribute to keep track of 
       changes in value when there is POINT_CONFLICT
 - Cannot move through exit
 - Implement Rules
     - config file can have no rules
     - turn limit and score rules > 0
     - first move is always player 1
         - game keeps track of which player is going
     - POINT_CONFLICT
         - if current player piece < opponent piece, opponent piece
           stay but value is reduced
         - if current player piece = opponent piece, both pieces removed
     - cannot have both REMOVE and POINT_CONFLICT
 - Observer
     - end of game there is tie, send message game is tie
     - getPieceAt does not need to notify observer if null
 - Refactor
 - Design Doc
     - Describe your final design with the decisions you made 
       and patterns implemented to come to that design.

======================================================================
To Do List:
 1. Modify old test cases to include rules - Done
      - Additional Test Cases
          - test remove true
          - test pointconflict true (check points are correct)
          - test game ends when it reaches turn limit or score
          - test Observers
          		- exceptions (out of bound, place piece on blocked location) 
          		- wrong player on turn
          		- piece at the "to" coordinate
          		- winner
 2. Modify EscapePiece to have attribute value and update value method - Done
 3. Fix abideRules method so piece cannot move through exit - Done
 4. Implement a GameState class to keep track of game - Done
      - which player turn
      - number of turns
      - number of points for each player
      - is game won
      		- know the winner
 5. Modify EscapeGameSdministrator - Done
      - move function to include rules and notify observers - Done
      - implement addObserver and remove Observer methods - Done
      - add a notify allObservers method - Done
 6. Refactor Code and Comments
