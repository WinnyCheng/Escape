======================================
move

Movement class
 - store movement pattern and attributes
 - check if a move follows pattern and attributes (abideRules function)
      - use BFS Algorithm to find path
      - represent current state of board as graph/map to run BFS
      
      Tests
      - OrthoMovementRules - Done
          - linear pattern (no jump, no fly, no unblocked)
          - orthogonal=omni pattern (no jump, no fly, no unblocked)
          - with jump
          - with fly
          - with unblocked
      - SquareMovementRules - Done
          - linear pattern (no jump, no fly, no unblocked)
          - orthogonal pattern (no jump, no fly, no unblocked)
          - diagonal pattern (no jump, no fly, no unblocked)
          - omni pattern (no jump, no fly, no unblocked)
          - with jump
          - with fly
          - with unblocked
      - HexMovementRules - Done
      	  - linear pattern (no jump, no fly, no unblocked)
          - omni pattern (no jump, no fly, no unblocked)
          - with jump
          - with fly
          - with unblocked
 
EscapePiece
 - canMove -> calls abideRules function in Movement class and return what it returns
 
EscapeGameManager
 - move -> calls canMove from EscapePiece and removes/place pieces on board
